Instructions for running the random number tests in this
repository.

Kolgomorov-Smirnov Test.

Run javaks.sh to apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the
etaus uniform random number generator.  There is no
parameter.

./javaks.sh

This test is expected to pass.

--------

etaus Binomial Distribution Test

Run binom.sh to perform a binomial test on the etaus random
number generator.

./binom.sh

This test is expected to pass.

--------

etaus Timing Test

Run timing.sh to perform a timing test on the etaus random
number generator.  The etaus generator is compared to the Java
Math.random() generator.

./timing.sh

This etaus generator is expected to perform as fast as Math.random().

--------

Dieharder suite of random number tests.

Run dietst.sh to apply dieharder tests to the etaus
random number generator.

./dietst.sh

This test is expected to pass with normal random weaknesses,
but with no failed tests.  When rerun, weaknesses do not repeat
on the same test.

--------

More random number tests.

You are welcome to contribute more Java random number tests
for this generator.
